We will calculate the age of the user based on the current year and the date of birth
step1:call
The call() method can bu used to invoke defined functions and methods to different object
step2:apply
the apply()method is very similiar to the call() method, but instead of passing arguments one after we pass them in an array
step3:bind
the bind method is a little bit different than the call and apply methhods. It does not call function but it returns it with a newly assigned "this" ketword.
we can later execute it passing required arguments. It Also enables "borrowing" methods from different object
